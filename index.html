            <h2>About Pig Dice</h2>
            <p>Pig Dice is a game played by two players. The first player is expected to roll the dice/play the game and whichever number appers on his/her side greater than one is their score. The player has an option of adding the number to his/her account
                so that in the end the one who archieves a score of 100 counts or more the first, is the winner of the game. When a player rolls a dice and gets one, the chance automatically goes to the other player.
